## By Adam Titus and Michael Arrington

Greetings Professor Falken...

## About

This web-based version of the popular game "tic-tac-toe" was coded in Javascript to satisfy the requirements for an Epicodus paired programming challenge. It's styled after the famous version in the 1983 movie _Wargames_. That said, it employs only rudimentary computer logic and the "GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR" option in the loading screen is not connected to a NORAD system.

## Installation

Please download from ```https://github.com/arringtonm/tictactoe.git
``` and open with your favorite text editor etc etc.
