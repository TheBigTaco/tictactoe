"specs"

on play:  board materializes
          any previous boards reset[]

objects:  players (or turns (x and o)
          determines where clicked for each player[]
          determines if valid (on top, outside, etc)

functions:determiner of win/loss/draw
          drawer
          slave function click listener
            determines if valid, then animation, checks for end of game conditions, switches turn

how triggered:
          on click listener with grid/box system

key value pairs:
          each box open, or claimed by either player
          which player gets X or O

how triggered:
          event listener (for clicks)

how info collected:
          names from input
          clicks for moves

behaviors (easiest to hardest):
          getting users' name
          click listening by area/div/whatever
          drawing/aninmating something in that area
          drawing board
          determining turn and alternating drawn object accordingly
          end of game:
            determining win
              three moves in a row
            draw:
              board is full with no win
            determining loss (against computer):
              sort of like win.

          ...

          player goes first or "coin flip"

          computers' logic (if made available)
            should always try to expand/complete an existing row/column/diagonal
